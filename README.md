This project displays the work of the "small" version of the YOLO nas model. This model detects the protective gear obtained from an already annotated roboflow and makes training tests based on that. The optimizer used for this was ADAM which is just a modified gradient descent optimizer to minimize the loss function.
The model understood and predicted the exact result we wanted with a high accuracy score of over 80% and more.

This image displays the model identifying the glove with its probability.
The notebook provided has step-by-step details of what is done and how it is done.
The data.yaml file contains the labels which are discussed int he said notebook.
